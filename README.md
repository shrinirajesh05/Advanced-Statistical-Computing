# Exploring Kidney Disease through Computer Simulations: Analyzing Missing Data, Associations, and Classification Techniques

Project Overview:

This project delves into the analysis and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a comprehensive dataset. The primary objectives of the study are to address missing data, explore key associations between variables, and improve classification techniques for kidney disease prediction. By employing advanced statistical methods, this research aims to enhance the understanding of kidney disease and contribute to more effective diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Key Objectives:

Handling Missing Data: Implement appropriate imputation techniques to address missing data and create a complete dataset for accurate analysis.
Bootstrap Resampling: Use resampling to estimate population parameters and compare variable means between patients with and without CKD.
Permutation Testing: Assess correlations to uncover statistically significant associations between variables.
Classification: Use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Monte Carlo simulations to classify patients and predict CKD presence.
Feature Selection: Apply permutation testing to identify important predictors and evaluate models with and without feature selection.
Logistic Regression: Compare logistic regression models with all variables and selected features to assess predictive accuracy.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of kidney disease patient data with various medical attributes that help determine the presence or absence of CKD. Key variables include:

Blood pressure (BP)
Specific gravity (SG)
Albumin level
Red blood cell count (RBC)
Blood urea
Serum creatinine
Hemoglobin (HGB)
Diabetes status
Hypertension status
Age

Project Workflow:
1. Handling Missing Data
Missing data is a common issue in medical datasets. Imputation techniques were used to fill in missing values, ensuring a complete dataset for accurate analysis. Multiple imputation was applied to reduce bias and increase the reliability of the analysis.

2. Bootstrap Resampling
Bootstrap resampling was employed to estimate population parameters by creating multiple samples from the dataset. This method also facilitated the comparison of variable means between CKD and non-CKD patients, highlighting key differences between the groups.

3. Permutation Testing
Permutation testing was performed to assess the significance of correlations between variables. This method tests the null hypothesis by shuffling the data, determining whether observed associations are statistically significant or the result of random chance.

4. Classification Models
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used for classification to predict CKD based on patient data. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to evaluate the robustness of the classification model.

5. Feature Selection
Feature selection techniques, such as permutation importance, were applied to identify the most relevant predictors for kidney disease classification. The study compared models with all attributes to models using only the selected features.

6. Logistic Regression Models
Two logistic regression models were developed:

Model 1: Using all attributes in the dataset.
Model 2: Using only the selected attributes identified through feature selection. The models were compared to assess predictive accuracy and determine whether reducing the number of predictors improved model performance.

Conclusion:

This project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding kidney disease by addressing missing data, exploring important variable associations, and enhancing classification models. The results contribute to better diagnosis and prediction of chronic kidney disease, offering valuable insights for medical research and patient care.
